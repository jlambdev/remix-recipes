# Remix Recipes

[Remix](https://remix.run/docs) website with a collection of favourite recipes, deployed to Vercel.

## Development

Uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Add dependencies with:

```sh
pnpm add <dep>
pnpm add -D <devDep>
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
