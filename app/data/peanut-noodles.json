    "Add water to a large pan and bring to boil. When boiling, add the noodles and cook to package instructions (e.g. 5 minutes).",
    "Heat a frying pan to medium-high heat. About 3 minutes before the noodles are cooked, add a small amount of cooking oil and fry the egg. You want the white part cooked with a runny yolk.",
    "When the noodles are ready, drain the water, then add the peanut/soy/sesame sauce to the noodles in the pan and mix together (alternatively, you can just add the noodles and sauce to the serving bowl directly & mix there).",
    "Lay the fried egg on top of the noodles. Season with salt and pepper",
    "Sprinkle the sliced onion over the egg. Enjoy!"
