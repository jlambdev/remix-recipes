    "Remove the bratwurst and put under the grill for 2-4 minutes to brown the outside, or cook them in a separate pan.",
    "Remove most of the liquid from the broth, add the flour and cook at least 1 minute (this will remove the floury taste).",
    "Add the liquid back to the broth/flour mix.",
    "Return the bratwurst to the broth and serve from the pan, or transfer the broth to a gravy boat :)"
