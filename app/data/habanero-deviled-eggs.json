    "Add the onions to a pre-heated saucepan with some cooking oil (e.g. olive, coconut oil).",
    "After around 3-4 minutes (when the onion is soft), add the garlic and pepper. Cook for another 3 minutes or so.",
    "Peel the eggs under cold running water. Transfer to a chopping board.",
    "Carefully remove the yolks and put them in a small mixing bowl. Add the mustard, mayonnaise and onion/pepper/garlic mix. Optionally add a dash of worcestershire sauce.",
    "Mix with a fork or spoon until the mixture becomes a mash (not fully smooth, some texture is good).",
    "Spoon or pipe the mixture back into the egg whites.",
    "Garnish the eggs with a very small amount of paprika - be careful not to put too much on, as it can have a gritty texture. Use a fine seive and only about 1/8th of a teaspoon of paprika. Enjoy!"
